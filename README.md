# DataCosmos-CMPE491-
This repository contains the DataCosmos documentation and project, which is the graduation project.

The project we'll work on will be similar to a system that finds links to items with low-quality labels automatically and displays them to the user, 
like akakce.com or cimri.com. Using the search terms used on the websites where artificial intelligence data is shared, 
we shall in this case execute the pertinent data sets. We will run a site search or keyword extraction (e.g., Google, Kaggle). 
A dataset rating system (out of five stars) will also be included and made available to users.
Data scientists and programmers of artificial intelligence are our target audience. We want to complete a project that is based on information retrieval.
